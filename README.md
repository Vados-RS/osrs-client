osrs-client
===========

The official client for http://www.runefeed.net

Latest binary snapshot for the current version can be downloaded here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/153111896/builds/osrs-client-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip

If the URL doesn't respond, it's because a new build is currently being created.

Scripting
-------------

The client now supports scripting using the Ruby programming language. An example script is provided in the "scripts" subfolder of the binaries, or in src/main/ruby in this repository.

This engine is in a very early stage and is prone to future changes. Functionality will grow as the project is fleshed out properly.
